            <p>Welcome to my first website! This is a simple page created to practice frontend web development skills.</p>

            <p>Imagine a beautiful summer's day. The birds chirp their individual songs; the wind breezes through the glowing green grass. The flowers sparkle like diamonds against the bright blue sky. But now imagine all this beauty being taken away from you. You can no longer hear the birds or see the flowers. You can no longer see or hear anything. This is what happened to Helen Adams Keller after succumbing to scarlet fever at the mere age of 18 months. Yet in spite of this hardship, Keller was able to triumph over hardship. She is an admirable woman of power who deserves the Lorax award. I admire Helen Adams Keller for her determination, intelligence, and inspirational life lived on earth.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Helen Keller's life exhibits an intelligent mind, amodel of inspiration. For example, before her teacher, Anne Sullivan entered her life: Helen wasn't completely shut off from the word. She did realize she was different, but she persevered to work past this handicap. She developed her own form of communication. This included such signs as pretending to cut a loaf of bread if she was hungry for a slice. Moreover, after Anne entered Helen's life, Helen learned sign language. Remarkably, her first comprehendible word was "water." She grew up to be an eager student, attended Radcliffe, obtained outstanding grades, and even wrote several books life inspirational books that has today influenced my life in one way or another.
                Some of her notable works include: <br>
                <br>
                <ul id="her-work">
                    <li>The Frost King (1891)</li>
                    <li>The Story of My Life (1903)</li>
                    <li>The World I Live In (1908)</li>
                    <li>My Religion (1927)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Thus, Helen Keller is indeed a woman of extreme power. She overcame dire obstacles to show determination, intelligence, and inspiration in her life. She knew that life was only as good as you make it. She overcame obstacles that many will never face, learned to take great leaps of blind faith and achieved. I celebrate her today.</p>
